    <small ">DECEMBER 2020</small>
    <p  class ="content-container" >For me it's always heart above everything else.

        Mind paves a practical path to live a straightforward life.
        
        Heart helps you in living your dreams, making impossible possible, or at least trying wholeheartedly, it gives you intensity and passion.
        
        The rollercoaster of a life I have had is all because of being a slave to my heart’s commands.
        
        And the best part is your heart doesn't see money, beauty, fame, and any materialistic object, it subtly notices your happiness, your superior purpose, your deep objectives in life. (And if you think the opposite, it's not your heart speaking, it's just the craving of pleasure)
        
        Listening to the heart may fail you in front of the entire world but you succeed in your own eyes. You feel joyful, satisfied and at peace with life.
        
        It saves you from regret.
        
        Well, that's my opinion because most people would call a person like me immature, childish or reckless, and somehow I find a positive connotation in all these words

<h1 style="padding-top: 4rem; padding-left:3rem ;">What is privacy ?</h1>
<small>JANUARY 2021</small>
<div class="content-container">After few days, my mother randomly took my phone and began to look at my gallery.

    And then she decided to open WhatsApp.
    
    “What have you done? Why is it locked” asked my mother surprisingly.
    
    “Nothing mummy. I just tried out the new fingerprint lock feature of WhatsApp” I excitedly replied.
    
    And then came the world famous “W” series of questions!
    
    “Why is the need to?”
    
    “What are you hiding?”
    
    “Whom are you dating?”
    
    “Who is your girlfriend?”
    
    “There’s nothing like that mummy. It’s just that there is a WhatsApp group of my friends where…..”
    
    “Open it now. I wanna see” interrupting me in between.
    
    At last, I had to open it.
    
    She went through my chats. Found nothing.
    
    She then went through that particular group.
    
    And there she found lots of words with extremely sweet, respectful and lovely language which we commonly use for our friends.
    
    She then left my phone, looked at me with a serious face and handed me the toughest punishment in the world.
    
    SUMMARY- Privacy is something which we middle class guys/girls don’t really get from our parents!
